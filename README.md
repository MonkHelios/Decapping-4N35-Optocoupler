## Decapping 4N35 Optocoupler:
In this project, we will only go over the process we undertook to successfully decap and expose the die of a rather common optocoupler - 4N35. Equivalent LET measurements are not in the scope of this project. We will also touch upon the methods undertaken by us which resulted in little to no success.

We used basic tools generally found in an electronics lab and a Swiss army knife (I mean, why not?) -
1. Hot air station
2. Flat file
3. Edge clamp
4. Isopropyl alcohol
5. Soft bristled brush (water colour brush)
6. Tweezer
