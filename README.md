## Decapping 4N35 Optocoupler:
In this project, we will only go over the process we undertook to successfully decap and expose the die of a rather common optocoupler - 4N35. Equivalent LET measurements are not in the scope of this project. We will also touch upon the methods undertaken by us which resulted in little to no success.
